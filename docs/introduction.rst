Introduction
============

The ``debops.ulogd`` role can is used to manage ``ulogd``, which wants to
provide a flexible, almost universal logging daemon for netfilter logging. This
encompasses both packet-based logging (logging of policy violations) and
flow-based logging, e.g. for accounting purpose.

``ulogd`` consists of a small core and a number of plugins. All the real power lies
in the plugins, and in the user who configures the interactions between those
plugins.

The role can also be used by other Ansible roles as a dependency to create global
environment variables in a safe way, that preserves idempotency.
