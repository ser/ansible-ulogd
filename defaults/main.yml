# The main logfile, where ulogd reports any errors, warnings and other

# Plugins. In the config file, this option is followed by a filename of
# a ulogd plugin, which ulogd should load upon initialization. This
# option may appear more than once.
#
# In DebOps plugins are split into several lists. First group use short naming,
# please consult listing of ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ulogd/`` directory
# or its equivalent in your host architecture to understand the methodology.
# Fullpath lists provide full path to each plugin.

# .. envvar:: ulogd__base_plugins
# List of plugins turned on by default in the DebOps role. These are really essential
# ones and it's hard to build a useful stack without them.

# .. envvar:: ulogd__stacks
# Stack. In the config file this option is followed by a list of plugin
# instances which will start with an input plugin, contains optional filtering
# plugin and finish by an output plugin. This option may appear more than once.
#
# In DebOps the stack is defined with YAML syntax. After defining a stack, you
# are able to extend it with options which configure that stack. 
#
# ATTENTION: by limitation of this role, names of plugin instances can not start with a capital letter or a number!
#
# It's an example use case for defining and configuring two stacks:
#
# ulogd__stack_shorewall:
#   - log1: 'BASE'
#     options:
#       group: 0
#       netlink_qtimeout: 100
#   - base1: 'BASE'
#   - ifi1: 'IFINDEX'
#   - emu1: 'LOGEMU'
#     options:
#       file: '/var/log/ulogg/syslogemu.log'
#       sync: 1
#
# ulogd__stack_ferm:
#   - log2: 'BASE'
#   - ifi2: 'IFINDEX'
#
# ulogd__stacks:
#   - '{{ ulogd__stack_shorewall }}'
#   - '{{ ulogd__stack_ferm }}'
#
# By default stack list is empty, as it is up to the dependent application to define desired stack of logging.
